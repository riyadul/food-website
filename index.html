            <p>
                Two years ago, I was in full development and testing mode for À Table, and had planned a summer trip
                from Paris to the south of France with friends. While the pretext was to celebrate a birthday, I knew I
                would be the friend setting food on the table and only half-jokingly asking for detailed feedback. <br>

                The eggplant confit slices are ideal served as a side, spread on crusty bread, or chopped up and strewn

            <h2>Kalavuna</h2>
            <p>
                Kalavuna is a cooking technique that can use high, medium, or even low heat, which means anything from
                steaks to burgers to even a whole roast can go on the grill. Cooking on a charcoal grill is trickier

            <h2>Dal</h2>
            <p>
                Dal usually starts by seasoning the beef, then browning it in a hot skillet before transferring it to a
                covered pot with a small amount of liquid, like stock or broth, plus aromatic ingredients like onions
                and carrots. An acidic ingredient like tomatoes or wine is usually included as well.

            <h2>Khuchiri</h2>
            <p>
                Khuchiri is a dry-heat cooking technique that uses either high temperature or a combination of high and
                low. The high temperature is what gives the beef its mouth-watering, crispy, brown exterior, while the
                low temperature is what cooks it to its proper doneness.

            <h2>Salad</h2>
            <p>
                Salad is like grilling upside-down. It's a high-temperature technique where the beef is cooked just
                inches away from the heat source. Only, instead of above the fire, as with grilling, the meat is
                situated below.
